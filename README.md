# Visual-Embedding-API

This is a small application with the objective to allow image similarity search. The API acts as an intermediary to an [Elastisearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) instance, where representations of images are stored. The app is deployed with Docker and AWS Lambda with the Serverless framwork.
